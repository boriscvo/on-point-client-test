1. If you had control of the web-server, what are some ways you might implement a caching
solution?
- CDN if money and support isn't a problem,
- Service Workers,
- Basic browser caching I guess, with cache headers,
- Caching static things like images,
- Things like NGINX for content caching when server is out.


2. How might you implement offline caching for your typeahead component?
- Some similar things as from answer no 1, CDN and service workers, I suppose.
- Maybe some local data source, if required data isn't too big. Cache-first logic. Not sure about this, though.
This is more a topic for specific management of request rather then the component itself. 
Its state says it will consume data from outside.


3. When using traditional session cookies, what are the primary security concerns and
mitigation techniques you might use?
- From my perspective - session expiration, timeout, logout... or, better say, the absence of it.
- Then the attacks, XSS, CSRF, Session hijack if they're still a thing. And, since they're still mentioned
in OWASP 10, which my current employer makes me review every year, they seem to be.


4. What are some advantages and disadvantages to using JWT for authorization and
authentication in a web application?

* Good side:
- Stateless and decentralized, no DB verification once it's out.
- It's JSON or can be JSON.

* Bad sides:
- To my knowledge, it can't be revoked or cancelled easily. However, you can make it with short time expiry. 
Which is per-se another con, potentially, since managing that process requires work.
- They're client side, you can actually read it with access to the browser/client session
and sometimes easily decode.


5. What are all the ways you can think of to write BAD React code?
- Copy/Paste cases, 
- When you don't criticaly overview online help you've found,
- Layer after layer after layer after... layer with no apparent reason,
- Ignore and leave browser console errors, even if they're harmless,
- Ignoring security things,
- When you trust server,
- Ignoring race conditions for requests,
- Using 'any' (TS)


6. What new Web or React APIs are you most excited about?
- Excited? None whatsoever, but now since you're asking, I'll google to see what you mean by that. 
- The last time I was excited about something new in React was when they released hooks, 
which practically matched Functional and Class components, but that was, like, 2019.

- Alright, I'll pick these "new" hooks introduced in 18. 
- I also see they kicked out IE11 support, I like that too.
